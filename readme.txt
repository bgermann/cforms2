cformsII is a customizable, flexible & powerful form plugin!

== Description ==

This is a fork of cformsII, a highly customizable, flexible and powerful form
builder plugin, covering a variety of use cases and features from attachments to
multi form management.

Oliver, the original author, does not further develop the plugin.
This fork is an effort to keep it up to date.

For a quick starter you should have a look at the [introduction video by Your Page Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBwu4J8SfVo).

If you want to use plugin versions older than 14.6.3, you should rename the
directory containing the plugin from "cforms2" to "cforms". But bear in mind
that old versions should not be used in public systems, because they contain
known serious vulnerabilities that are exploited in the wild. The current
security baseline version is 14.11.

= Related Plugins =

cformsII has pluggable CAPTCHA support.
[Really Simple CAPTCHA for cformsII](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cforms2-really-simple-captcha)
provides an image CAPTCHA. To convert the old CAPTCHA fields to Really
Simple CAPTCHA, please install the current version and activate the plugin.

[Contact Form DB](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-to-database-extension)
has support for storing cformsII's submission data and exporting in more
formats than cformsII does. Therefore cformsII's database tracking will be
removed in the long run.

= Reporting Bugs =

If you happen to find a bug, please feel free to report a bug at the support
forum, but please be sure to follow these rules:

* Search the forum. Someone may have had the exact same issue.
* Give your report a meaningful title.
* Include WordPress and cformsII version numbers and optionally
  PHP version number you use.
* If you happen to run your webserver on Microsoft Windows, which is very uncommon,
  please provide this information.
* Read the FAQ before reporting.
  If you post a question about emails not being sent,
  be sure to include the information that you tried Check Email plugin at least.
  Otherwise your post will be ignored.

== Installation ==

= Installing the plugin =

You can install the plugin via WordPress Dashboard. It should show up by
searching for cforms2. If this does not work for you, there should be an option
to upload a zip file, which is available on the
[wordpress.org plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cforms2/).

If you want to install manually, please upload the complete plugin folder
"cforms2", contained in the zip file, to your WordPress plugin directory!

If you want to check integrity of the download, please use the cforms2.*.zip
downloads and the corresponding .sig
GPG signature files that are published via
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/bgermann/cforms2/releases).
The [key used for signing](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0x2626D16964438E53)
has the fingerprint `D942 6F96 37DC A799 FF0F  9AF2 2626 D169 6443 8E53`.
The git tags themselves are also signed beginning with version 14.8.

Please note that cformsII depends on [PHP Session Extensions](http://php.net/manual/book.session.php),
which are enabled by default.

= Upgrading the plugin =

If you want to upgrade from the original cformsII from deliciousdays.com, please
upgrade to [version 14.6.0.5](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/cforms2/assets/cforms2.14.6.0.5.zip)
first, make sure you upgraded your settings (resave your global settings and every form)
and [backup your database](https://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database).
Then deactivate the original plugin and install the current version of this fork.

If you want to delete the 14.6.0.5 version by deleting directory "cforms" and
you have any cforms-uploaded files, make sure you do not delete your attachments
directory, which is contained in the cforms directory by default.

= Did you modify any cforms theme (CSS) files? =

Create a custom folder under your WordPress plugin directory & call it "cforms-custom".
Move all your custom files into it. This folder will protect your changes going
forward.

Check out the
[cforms CSS Guide](http://www.deliciousdays.com/download/cforms-css-guide.pdf)
on layout customization.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I do not get any emails from my form. Why? =

Most probably this is not cformsII's fault. Please check your WordPress mail
configuration with a plugin like
[Check Email](https://wordpress.org/plugins/check-email/).
If that reports not to work, you don't have a mail server running or its
settings are broken. Please fix it yourself, tell your hosting provider or
use an external SMTP plugin (see the next question).

= Where are the external SMTP settings? =

That function was removed. The WordPress function
[wp_mail](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_mail) is used for
mails now, which makes use of built-in PHPMailer.
If you want to configure it to use an external SMTP server, use an appropriate
plugin, e.g. [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/)
or [Postman SMTP Mailer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/).

= Why is the Form Settings page broken? =

This was an incompatibility with WordPress 4.2 that was fixed with cformsII 14.9.3.
Be sure to use a current version.

= Where can I find old cformsII versions? =

You can find old versions in the
[Developers section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cforms2/developers/).

= I upgraded and lost my widgets. What can I do? =

Beginning with 14.6.10 WordPress 2.8 Widget API is used for cforms widgets.
You have to recreate your widgets. You can find your old settings in debug
output on the Global Settings Admin menu.
Just search for widgets with your browser's search.

= How can I contribute code? =

Please use [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/bgermann/cforms2/pulls).

= Where are comment and Tell-a-Friend fields? =

These features were remove with version 14.12.


== Localization ==

You can see the available languages and contribute via [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/cforms2).

If your language is not available, you can find a list of the
[translations for the original cforms version](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103044209/http://www.deliciousdays.com/cforms-plugin/),
which also work with this fork.
To use one of those files, please rename the cforms-?.mo file to
cforms2-?.mo and put it in the wp-content/languages/plugins directory.


== Roadmap ==
